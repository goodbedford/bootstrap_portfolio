          <h3 class="description">The idea for actstat came from my own experience discovering my city after college. Shortly after graduation, I began teaching in a high school only about twenty miles from where I grew up. I was shocked at how so close to home, less than 50% of students were graduating high school and many students did not know how to read at a third grade level, yet alone a high school level. I felt as if I did not really know my city the way I thought I did-I did not have a full understanding for its needs and if/how these needs were being addressed. This web application therefore exposes you to various statistics about your city and then allows you to click on a statistic that stands apart to you. Once you have clicked you are then redirected to a page that tells you about local nonprofits that are addressing these statistics. The purpose of actstat is to make you aware of your community’s needs, but also to perhaps encourage you to volunteer for or donate to these nonprofits. </h3>

          <h3 class="description">I worked in a group of three to create this as our second project for the Web Development Immersive course. Spots is an application that allows you to visualize your circle’s favorite spots around town. It was built using Ruby on Rails, Google Places API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You can think of Spots as an internal Yelp for your family, friends, or colleagues. You can either create a group or join a group and then make or view recommendations. We wanted to help make it visually simple to find the spots that you have been recommended to check out and then allow you to see who has reviewed that place and what has been said about it. Whether your social circles are marking restaurants, cafes, parks, hiking trails, bookstores, movie theaters, or trampoline gymnasiums, we want you to know what is around you so that you too could get to know the city you call home. We hope to see you using this new platform! Spots-the new way to discover your city.</h3>
